	<h1><u><strong><em>What is Marvel?</em></strong></u></h1>
	<p>We are Marvel studioes.</p>
		<p>One of the most biggest entertainment out there</p>
		<p>Marvel Comics, American media and entertainment company that was widely regarded as one of the “big two” publishers in the comic industry. Its parent company, Marvel Entertainment, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Disney Company. Its headquarters are in New York City. </p>
		<p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films, independently produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.</p>
		<p>In April 2013, Marvel Studios moved its executive production offices from Manhattan Beach Studios Media Campus to The Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. </p>
		<p>Unlike Universal, Warner Bros., and other movie lots, The Walt Disney Company does not offer regular public tours of its studios. But there are two ways you could make it past the gates. As part of its Southern California itinerary, Adventures by Disney takes vacationers to the Burbank lot for a guided visit.</p>
		<p>The Walt Disney Company announced a deal to acquire Marvel Comics' parent corporation, Marvel Entertainment, for $4 billion or $4.2 billion, with Marvel shareholders to receive $30 and 0.745 Disney shares for each share of Marvel they own.</p>
